## Presentation
  For our challenge, we are making a star field. We are going to make a simulation of stars moving at warp speed.

  We are going to walk you through the base code and then show you a few spinoffs that we made so that you can make your own.

  -Program initial code
  -Show each of our versions
  -Everyone walks around helping
